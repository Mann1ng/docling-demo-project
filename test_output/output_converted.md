## PREFACE

This Code of Practice for the Defined Interstate Rail Network was developed by the rail industry.

The  Australian  Transport  Council  agreed  to  an  Inter-Governmental  Agreement  (IGA)  for  Rail Uniformity  in  November  1999.  As  a  result  of  this  agreement  the  Australian  Rail  Operations  Unit (AROU)  was  established  from  1  January  2000  to  work  with  industry  to  finalise  and  implement  a Code  of  Practice  for  the  Defined  Interstate  Rail  Network.    The IGA  also  provided  for  the establishment  of an  Industry Advisory  Committee  (IAC)  to  assist  the  AROU.    Prior  to  the establishment of the AROU an Industry Reference Group working under the auspices of SCOT Rail Group produced the first draft of a set of National Codes of Practice for Railways.

The  work  has  been  sponsored  by  the  rail  industry,  the  Australasian  Railway  Association,  State, Northern Territory and Commonwealth Governments.

This Code includes Volumes for each operational and engineering discipline and a Glossary defining the terminology used.

The General Requirements and Interface Management Code is a common document relevant to all railway  disciplines.    The  other  Volumes  in  the  Code  of  Practice  address  the  detailed  principles, guidelines and mandatory requirements related to the individual disciplines for the range of railway activities comprising the defined interstate rail network.

The Commonwealth Government through the Commonwealth Department of Transport and Regional Services is responsible for administering issues related to the update and maintenance of the  Code based  on  advice  from  industry.   Code  Management  procedures  for  the  Code  of  Practice for  the Defined Interstate Rail Network are available from the Department.

The Code of Practice has been developed specifically to meet the uniformity requirements for the Defined Interstate Rail Network (DIRN).  This Network excludes any  yards, sidings and terminals, which  may  be  associated  with  the  Network  by  way  of  access,  geographic  location  or  any  other reason. The practices detailed provide three (3) levels of information as follows:

- (a) Principles  providing  guidance  and  information  to  railway  organisations  on  issues  that should be considered.
- (b) Guidelines that provide guidance on one means of meeting some of the requirements of AS 4292.
- (c) Mandatory  requirements  necessary  to  enable  the  operational  objectives  of  the  1998 report titled "Study of Rail Standards and Operational Requirements" to be reached.

The principles, guidelines  and mandatory requirements have not been developed for use by other railway networks and are not relevant to special application railways such as sugarcane and heavy haul railways, which are constructed, operated and maintained in ways that meet the specific needs of those operations.  In these cases special operating and technical requirements and standards, not provided for in this Code of Practice, will normally apply to accommodate the particular environments in which they operate.

The  mandatory  requirements  for  the  DIRN  do  not  require  application  retrospectively  and  are generally  applicable  in  the  case  of  significant  upgrading  and  modification,  new  construction  or  in the implementation of new systems. Infrastructure and rollingstock built to standards in existence prior  to  the  publication  of  this  Code  of  Practice  may  be  restricted  in  their  use.  Other practices deemed  mandatory  for  the DIRN  would  require a period of time to provide for implementation, particularly  in  the  case  of  operational  and  safeworking  systems.    The  staged implementation  of  these  requirements  will  be  the  subject  of  an  industry based  implementation plan  developed  in association with the Australian Rail Operations Unit.

The Code of Practice  includes  significant  sections  that  are  notated  as  'To  Be  Determined'  or  'To Be  Inserted', which  with  amendments  to  existing  clauses  will  be  the  subject  of  continuing development.

## 1 SECTION 1:  SCOPE AND IMPLEMENTATION

## 1.1 INTRODUCTION

The Foreword to AS 4292 Parts 2 to 5-1997 is as follows:

## 'FOREWORD

A  means  of  complying  with  this  Standard  may  be  by  an  organisation  entering  into  a commitment to conform to a code of practice which has  been deemed by an appropriate authority  to  comply  in  respect  of  the  organisation's  type  of  operation.    It  is  envisaged that  in  time,  a  range  of  codes  of  practice  applicable  to  specific  railway  activities  may  be developed to address different types of railway operation such as tramways, tourist/heritage, short  haul  and  advanced  technology  railways,  as  well  as  interstate  and other main line operations.'

This Code of practice has been developed as a means of complying with parts of AS 4292 in the context of the Defined Interstate Rail Network.

In conformity with AS 4292, before applying the Code to individual railway operations it is always  necessary  to  determine  the  level  of  risk  the  application  of  the  Code  imposes  on such  railway  operations.    As  with  AS  4292,  in  making  this  determination  at  least  the following matters are to be taken into account:

- (a) The role of the railway.
- (b) The  function  in  the  organisation  of  the  person,  corporation,  contractor  or  supplier who is applying the Code.
- (c) The commercial agreements between owners, operators and functional areas.
- (d) The promotion of commercial and technological innovation.
- (e) Existing safety procedures and practices.
- (f) The need to determine which life cycle phases are applicable to an organisation.

## 1.2 APPLICATION FRAMEWORK

- (a) Subject to any  relevant  legislation, the Code  of  Practice  is  only  intended  to supplement AS 4292.  In the event of any inconsistency between-
- (i) the application of any part of AS 4292 and the Code; or
- (ii) the  interpretation  of  a  provision  of  AS 4292  with  the  Code or a  provision  of  the Code;

AS 4292 is to prevail.

- (b) Any  procedures  or  training  manuals  prepared  by  a  railway  organisation  are  to  be read subject to the following order of precedence:
- (i) AS 4292.
- (ii) The Code.
- (c) The  Code  of  Practice  for  the  Defined  Interstate  Rail  Network  (hereafter  called  the "Code")  is  aimed  at  those  involved  in  management  and  work  activities  associated with  railways  on  the  Defined  Interstate  Rail  Network.    In  this  context  the  intention of the Code is to provide a more unified, harmonised and efficient operation than that which existed prior to its publication.  The Code seeks to facilitate, trains of differing sizes, characteristics, types, and purposes with differing owners and train managers to  operate  on  and  between  the  rail  networks  that  constitute  the  Defined  Interstate

## Rules

Rail  Network  giving  one  type  of  rail  operation  no  advantage  over  that  of  another whilst at the same time providing capacity for efficiency and innovation.

- (d) The  Code  sets  out  principles,  guidelines  and  mandatory  requirements  aimed  at providing a uniform approach to rail operations and supporting the provision of safe and efficient infrastructure, rollingstock and operating systems.
- (e) Where adopted, the principles, guidelines and mandatory requirements described in the  Code shall be  incorporated  into  the  management  systems  of  the  owner  or operator by implementing standards and procedures based on these practices.  It is recommended that a review of the Code precede its adoption to ensure compatibility with the existing systems.
- (f) The Code applies to work activities undertaken in all functional areas of the railway. The  uniformity  and  underlying  safety  management  principles  are  stated.    Uniform requirements for health and fitness, competency, management and associated issues for rail workers are described.  Requirements for interface coordination management are also described, including identification of issues for which  interface  coordination should be implemented.

## 2 SECTION 2:  PRINCIPLES AND REQUIREMENTS

## 2.1 PURPOSE

The purpose of this  document  is  to  define  the  safety  principles  and  requirements  for  the operation  of  safeworking  systems  and  the  issue  of  Occupancy  Authorities  (Authorities)  to ensure the safe movement of trains.

## 2.2 SAFEWORKING SYSTEMS

## 2.2.1 General description of systems and Authorities

Safeworking systems are integrated  systems  of  operating  procedures  and technology  for the safe operation of the railway.  Authorities are described as follows:

- (a) Authorities are the means  employed  by  safeworking  systems  to  manage  the conditions  by  which  trains,  track  machines  and  workers  access  the  track.    The Authority types listed in this Clause are defined in the Glossary (Volume 2).
- (b) Safeworking systems may grant Authorities in various ways, depending on the degree of technology provided, for example-
- (i) by electronic display;
- (ii) by signal indications erected trackside;
- (iii) by recording on paper; or
- (iv) by token.
- (c) Authorities  allow  trains,  track  vehicles  machines,  workers  and  their  equipment  to occupy a defined part of track or infrastructure.
- (d) Authorities for use by trains are as follows:
- (i) Proceed Authority (PA)
- (ii) Proceed Restricted Authority (PRA)
- (iii) Work Authority (WA)
- (iv) Shunt Authority (SHA)
- (v) Conditional Proceed Authority (CPA)
- (e) Authorities used for track or infrastructure work are as follows:
- (i) Local Possession (LP)
- (ii) Track Occupancy Authority (TOA)
- (iii) Track Work Authority (TWA)
- (f) An Authority may grant exclusive or joint occupancy of a section of track.
- (g) Joint  occupancy  rules  are  used  within  the  safeworking  system  to  determine  under what conditions an Authority may be granted.

Other arrangements for track work not involving the issue of Authorities may also be used within the safeworking system.  These are:-

- ï· Train Running Information (TRI)
- ï· No Authority Required (NAR)

## Rules

## 2.2.2 Summary of system requirements

The requirements for safeworking are summarised as follows:

- (a) A safe distance between movements shall be maintained (see Clause 2.4).
- (b) The integrity of a route shall be maintained once the Authority for a movement has been given (see Clause 2.7).
- (c) The  limitations  of  the  types  of  the  safeworking  system shall be  documented  and justified for particular applications (see Clause 2.2.5).
- (d) The principles for Authorities shall be satisfied before track occupancy is authorised (see Clause 2.5).
- (e) The Authority shall be such that it enables the safe control of a movement according to the related rules, track and train traffic conditions (see Clause 2.6).
- (f) Crossing controls shall be in place at designated level crossings (see Clause 2.8).

## 2.2.3 Safeworking system types

The following are types of safeworking systems in common use.  The list is not exhaustive.

- (a) ELECTRONIC AUTHORITY SYSTEMS (EAS)

EAS is a communications-based system and comprises the issue of a PA, which authorises a  train  to  move  between  specified  points.    The  train  crew  is  required  to  comply with  the instruction  in  the  Authority  in  addition  to  any  signal.    The  route  over  which  a  train  is authorised  to  move  is  verified  as  clear  by  train  control  and  the  Authority  system.    The Authority  is  transmitted  direct  to  the  train  crew  and  displayed  either  electronically  or  in hard  copy  form.    The  setting  and  verification  of  points  is  undertaken  by  the  train  crews themselves  at  unattended  block  locations,  or  by  workers  at  attended  locations,  but  they are required to comply with instructions contained in the Authority for that movement or by rules.  Crossing and passing information may also be included in the Authority.

## (b) TRAIN ORDER WORKING (TOW)

TOW is a communications-based system and comprises the issue of a PA in the form of a Train  Authority,  which  authorises  a  train  to  move  between  specified  points  and  is  issued by train control to the train crew or to workers who arrange delivery to the train crew.  The train  crew  is  required  to  comply  with  the  instructions  in  the  train  order  together  with  any additional signal indications.

The route over which a train is authorised to move by a Train Authority is verified as clear either through manual procedures or with computer assistance.  The setting and verification of  points  is  undertaken  by  the  train  crew  themselves  at  unattended  block  locations  or  by workers at attended locations and are required to comply with instructions contained with the train order or by rules which include the requirements for crossing or passing of trains.

## (c) CENTRALISED TRAFFIC CONTROL (CTC)

CTC  is  a  signalled  system  and  comprises  the  operation  of  track  side  fixed  signals  and points  from  a  train  control  location  by  the  train  controller  with  responsibility  for  one  or more sections.  Train control may be assisted by signal controllers either at the train control location  or  at  other  locations  along  the  route.  Each  section  may  be  subdivided into a series of separately signalled track sections.  Automatic block signalling may be provided for defined blocks within a CTC system where, under normal running, the control of trains by train control is not required.  PA is given by fixed signal indication.

## (d) AUTOMATIC BLOCK SIGNALLING (ABS)

ABS is a signalled system and comprises the automatic operation of trackside fixed signals at successive locations along the route.  Operation of fixed signals by track circuit,

or  other  train  detection  means,  may  be  applied  in  some  or  all  of  each  defined  length  of track.  PA is given by signal indication.

## (e) ELECTRIC STAFF (ES)

ES  is  a  token  system.   It  comprises  the  issue  of  a  PA  in  the  form  of  a  token  or staff obtained  from  an  electric  staff  instrument.    The  PA  remains  in  force  for  as  long as  the token or staff is in the possession of the train crew.

An electric staff instrument is provided at each end of the section and each holds a number of  tokens/staffs.    The  two  staff  instruments  are  electrically  interlocked  so  that  only  one token/staff  can  be  removed  from  either  instrument  at  any  one  time.    The  safety  of  the system depends upon the correct operation of the electric staff instruments.

The  Authority  to  enter  the  section  is  the  train  crew  being  in  possession  of  the  token  or staff for that section and by signal indication where provided. The setting and verification  of  points  may  be  undertaken  by  the  train  crew  themselves  at  unattended locations or by workers at attended locations.

## (f) STAFF AND TICKET (S&amp;T)

S&amp;T  is  a  token  system.    It  comprises  the  issue  of  a  PA  in  the  form  of  a  staff,  or where there is to be a following train in the same direction, a ticket.  The system generally allows  for  only  one  train  to  be  in  the  section  at  one  time.    However,  on  sections  where following movements are authorised within the section, tickets are kept in the staff box at each end of  the  section.    The  staff  box  can  only  be  unlocked  by  the  train  staff  for  the particular section.

The  safety  of  the  system  depends  upon  the  correct  handling  of  the  staff,  and  where required, the tickets.

The Authority to enter the section is the staff or ticket.  Each train entering the section is required  to  be  in  possession  of  the  staff  or  ticket  for  that  section  and  when  provided, comply with signal indications.   When  trains  are  proceeding  on  a  ticket, the  train  crew  is required to sight the staff for the relevant section prior to departure.

The  setting  and  verification  of  points  is  undertaken  by  the  train  crews  themselves  or  by workers at unattended locations.

## 2.2.4 System comparisons

Safeworking  systems  make  use  of  the  PA  more  frequently  than  any  other  Authorities. This is  because  the  PA  is  used  for  authorising  the  normal  movement  of  trains.    The  way the  PA  is  presented  to  the  train  crew  and  how  the  route  is  managed  and  verified  is dependent on the type of safeworking system in use.  Notable differences between systems are shown in Table 2.1.

## 2.2.5 System limitations

The following procedures apply:

- (a) Irrespective  of  the  type  of  technology  used  within  a  safeworking  system,  there  will be some residual risk i.e. there are some hazards that the technology cannot protect against.  When conducting risk assessments, these limitations shall be documented, together with justification as to why these limitations are acceptable for the particular application.  All stakeholders need to be aware and appreciate the significance of the limitations.
- (b) Controls shall be provided to  address  any  residual  risk  to  a  level  that  is  as  low  as reasonably practicable and such controls shall be documented.

## Rules

## 2.3 SAFEWORKING SYSTEM-AUTHORITY SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROCESS

## 2.3.1 Four-step process

Safeworking  systems  use  a  common  four-step  process  for  managing  Authorities. These can be summarised as follows:

- (a) Information Management (train and track status)
- (b) Decision Making (rules for Authority safety validation)
- (c) Authority Issue (transmission process)
- (d) Execution of the Authority (implementing the Authority)

An error or failure in any of the four steps may lead to an accident regardless of whether the  process  for  managing  the  step  is  dependent  on  human  behaviour,  conventional signalling relay technology, computer based or other technologies.

## 2.3.2 Dependency for safety

The dependency for safety by each type of safeworking system is indicated in Table 2.2.

## 2.4 TRAIN SEPARATION REQUIREMENTS

## 2.4.1 Running movements (trains operating on a PA)

The following apply:

- (a) A safe separation shall be assured by spacing trains according to their speed, braking capability and the track gradient.
- (b) The  safeworking  system shall  not permit  the  authorisation  of  a  train  to  enter  the route  until  the  route  plus  any  applicable  overlap  is  proved  clear  and  rollingstock gauge and overhang limits are complied with.
- (c) Safe separations distance shall consist of-
- (i) the braking distance from the allowed or attainable safe maximum speed; and
- (ii) a  margin  for  safety  that  reflects  factors  such  as  the  maximum  train  speed,  the type  of  train  and  its  braking  ability,  and  the  presence  or  otherwise  of  a  train protection system.
- (d) A safe separation shall be assured by either
- (i) providing an overlap beyond the limit of Authority; or
- (ii) by controlling the entry speed of the train into a route where a full overlap is not available.

## 2.4.2 Other movements (trains operating on a PRA, WA or SHA)

The safeworking system shall allow the authorisation of a train to enter a route where one of the following conditions apply:

- (a) The  route  is  proved  clear  taking  into  account  rollingstock  gauge  limits  and  an allowance for overhang.
- (b) The route is occupied by another train that is not moving.
- (c) The route is occupied by another train that has departed and is not returning.

## 2.4.3 Braking distance requirements

The following apply:

- (a) Braking  distance shall be  the  service  braking  distance  and shall be  derived  for each limit of Authority, taking into consideration the following parameters:
- (i) the characteristics of trains that are normally intended to operate on the line;
- (ii) the maximum speed, service brake, deceleration rate and brake delay time of the train involved for any specific location;
- (iii) the gradient of the track; and
- (iv) the  maximum  permissible  track  speed,  including  location  and  any  track  related speed restrictions.
- (b) Where  there  are  trains  with  different  characteristics,  the  braking  distance shall be the longest of all the different trains that would normally operate over the route.

## 2.4.4 Overlap distance requirements

The following apply:

- (a) A distance (overlap) beyond a limit of Authority shall be considered as a margin of safety against the train overrunning the limit of Authority due to, for example, slippery rails, or misjudgement by the train crew.
- (b) Factors  to  be  taken  into  consideration  in  determining  the  overlap  distance  include the following:

## Rules

- (i) the characteristics of trains that are normally intended to operate on the line;
- (ii) the warning provided prior to the limit of Authority;
- (iii) the  distance  the  train  has  to  travel  between  the  last  warning  and  the  limit  of Authority;
- (iv) the maximum speed, deceleration rate and brake delay time of the train involved;
- (v) the average gradient of the track between the last warning and the limit of Authority;
- (vi) the maximum permissible line speed, including location and any speed restrictions;
- (vii) possible  distractions  to  the  trains'  approach  to  a  limit  of  Authority  e.g.  a crew change or a stopping place after the last warning;
- (viii)    sighting distance (or time) the train crew has of the limit of Authority;
- (ix) the presence or otherwise of ATP; and
- (x) the provision of any conditional warnings or train speed checking which controls the approach speed of the train.

## 2.4.5 Sighting distance requirements

The following apply:

- (a) Sighting  distance shall be  sufficient  for  the  train  crew  to  sight  an  approaching  limit of Authority and any prior warning, in time to take action to control the train so as to minimise the likelihood of exceeding the limit of Authority.
- (b) Sighting  distance shall be  determined  as  not  less  than  the  distance  calculated  to provide a reasonable approach viewing time for the train crew.

## 2.4.6 Train location requirements and recommendations

To ensure train separation is maintained it is necessary to know the location of all trains, items of rollingstock, other on-track vehicles and worksites.  The following apply:

- (a) The level of integrity of the train location system shall be consistent with the overall safety integrity of the safeworking system.
- (b) Whatever  system  is  used  it shall  not fail  to  detect  the  presence  of  a  train  or  any other on-track vehicle that it is intended to detect.
- (c) The train location system shall have an accuracy that is appropriate to the method of separation of trains i.e. fixed or moving block systems, and the safeworking system.
- (d) There shall be compatibility between trains, the track infrastructure, overhead electric traction systems and the train location system where the location system automatically detects the presence of a train.
- (e) The detection system shall be sufficiently  precise to  ensure that the position of the train  in  relation  to  the  point  to  be  protected,  e.g.  at  a  convergence  of  two  tracks,  is known with an accuracy necessary to ensure safety.
- (f) Unless  it  can  be  shown  that  the  risk  of  a  train  unknowingly  becoming  divided  is acceptably  low,  the  train  detection  system  should  be  capable  of  identifying  and safeguarding against the effects of train division.
- (g) Systems  which  rely  on  memory  devices,  e.g.  axle  counters, shall incorporate  a defined  means  of  bringing  them  back  into  use  following  any  maintenance  or  other disruption or failure.
- (h) Train location and detection may be used to-
- (i) prove that a specific section of track is unoccupied;

## Rules

- (ii) detect the presence of a train etc on a specific track section;
- (iii) detect the arrival of a train etc at a particular location;
- (iv) detect the departure of a train etc from a particular location;
- (v) identify the location of the front of the train;
- (vi) identify the location of the rear of a train;
- (vii) detect the direction of travel of a train.
- (i) Location and detection systems include direct observation, reporting, track circuits, axle counters, and global positioning systems.

## 2.5 TRACK OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS

Tables  2.3  and  2.4  describe  track  occupancy  requirements  for  trains  and  track  work respectively  in  terms  of  Authority  selection  and  shows  how  each  type  of  Authority  is communicated within the safeworking system.
